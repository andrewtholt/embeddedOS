I'm going to base this on Redis, with some changes to compact the packet.

So a redis SET command looks like :

1: *3\r\n
2: $3\r\n
3: SET\r\n
4: $4\r\n
5: TEST\r\n
6: $4\r\n
7: DATA\r\n

For simplicity I will omit the \r\n

So, 3, the command is one of a group, so if we allow a single byte, then:

NOP=0x00
SET=0x01
GET=0x02
SUB=0x03
UNSUB=0x04

And we can remove the end of line, and the cmd length:

|*|3|0x01|$|4|T|E|S|T|$|5|D|A|T|A|
